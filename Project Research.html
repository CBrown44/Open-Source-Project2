        <h1>Breif Description Of Open Source</h1>
        <p>The Open source initiative was founded in february 1988 to promote the use of both the term open source and its application. Open source allows a code to be copied and then used with no repercussions from copyright law. It competed with the term free software to hold the definition, as both are practically the exact same thing, however due to open source sounding far more friendly for corporations it won out in the end and became the widely used term today. People can then take these codes as both examples for coding a specific topic, and for inserting or modifying their pieces of code long after the main developer may have stopped supporting the code. Open source is code freely posted somewhere for others to use. Open source is totally free, it's not protected under copyright laws, it was founded in 1988, and it enabled the spreading of creations to others without monetary transaction.</p>
